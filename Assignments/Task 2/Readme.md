# Suppose you are making a program for a very famous IoT Inverter company, company have multiple inverters with multiple business logic,

use cases:

company have PCU, GTI, Zelio, Regalia, iCruze Inverters,

- All Inverters have Power rating which is determined by ( Current * Operating Voltage ) 
- Only PCU, GTI and Regalia are solar Inverters other are not (solar inverters get charge by solar panels and solar energy),
- Solar Inverters have Solar Panels also
- Solar Inverters further have two option one Battery version that whatever energy is produced will be stored in battery other will not stor any energy,
- so PCU comes with battery but GTI have no battery,
- Solar Inverter also have GRID On , system where you can sell your extra energy back, GTI is GRID On where as this feature is not available in PCU,
- Non Solar Inverters are Simple Home Inverters Which have a Battery,
