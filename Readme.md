# System Design: Low-Level Design

This repository contains solutions to Low-Level Design (LLD) problems that have been asked in interviews at product-based companies include Google, Meta, and Amazon. The solutions are designed following best practices such as the SOLID, DRY, and KISS principles, along with standard design patterns.

# Key Design Principles

SOLID: A set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

1. Single-responsibility principle
2. Open-closed principle
3. Liskov substitution principle
4. Interface segregation principle
5. Dependency inversion principle

*DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):* A principle aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or data normalization to avoid bugs and improve maintainability.

*KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):* A principle that states most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated. Simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

*Design Standards:* This refers to using established design patterns and conventions that promote code readability, reusability, and scalability.
